# SOLID Design Principles — Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning **SOLID design principles**
through **clear explanations**, **code examples**, and **handwritten diagrams**.

The focus is not just on definitions, but on understanding:
- why designs break,
- how poor structure affects scalability,
- and how SOLID principles improve maintainability.

Each principle is covered with:
- a short conceptual explanation,
- code that **violates** the principle,
- a **corrected design** that follows the principle,
- and diagrams to visualize the idea.

## 📌 Learning Order

The principles are organized in the following order:

1. **SRP — Single Responsibility Principle**  
   👉 [01-SRP](./01-SRP)

2. **OCP — Open/Closed Principle**  
   👉 [02-OCP](./02-OCP)

3. **LSP — Liskov Substitution Principle**  
   👉 [03-LSP](./03-LSP)

4. **ISP — Interface Segregation Principle**  
   👉 [04-ISP](./04-ISP)

5. **DIP — Dependency Inversion Principle**  
   👉 [05-DIP](./05-DIP)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Strengthen Low-Level Design (LLD) fundamentals  
- Build intuition behind SOLID principles  
- Practice thinking in terms of responsibilities and abstractions  
- Create a reference for future system design and interviews  

This repository is intentionally **evolved over time** as my understanding grows.

## 🛠 Languages & Tools Used

- Java (for design examples)
- Handwritten diagrams (for clarity)
- Git & GitHub (for versioned learning)

## 📎 Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a framework-specific project.
